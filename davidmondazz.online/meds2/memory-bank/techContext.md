# Technical Context

## Technologies Used
- **Backend**: PHP
- **Database**: MySQL (indicated by SQL files)
- **Frontend**: HTML, CSS, JavaScript
- **Development Environment**: Laragon (Windows)
- **Web Server**: Likely Apache (based on Laragon default)

## Development Setup
The application is hosted in a Laragon environment on Windows, with the workspace path at:
```
C:/laragon/www/meds2_online
```

## File Structure
- `/js` - JavaScript files
- `/img` - Image assets
- `/crons` - Scheduled tasks
- `/css` - Stylesheet files
- `/temp` - Temporary files
- `/.vscode` - Visual Studio Code configuration

## Key Files
- `index.php` - Main application entry point
- `med_functions.php` - Core medication-related functions
- `db.php` - Database connection configuration
- `combo.php` - Medication combination handling
- `side_investigation.php` - Side effects analysis
- `daypage.php` - Daily tracking interface

## Database Structure
The database appears to track:
- Medications
- Side effects
- Medication combinations
- User experiences
- Timestamps for when medications were taken

A SQL file `create_med_combos_table.sql` suggests the database includes a table for medication combinations.

## Technical Dependencies
Based on the file structure, the application appears to have minimal external dependencies, primarily relying on:
- PHP core functions
- MySQL database
- Basic JavaScript (possibly with some libraries)

## Technical Constraints
- Traditional PHP application architecture (not framework-based)
- Direct database queries rather than an ORM
- File-based routing rather than a router
- Likely designed for specific browser compatibility
