# Cursor Rules for Meds Online

## Project Patterns

### File Organization
- PHP files at root level handle specific functionality
- CSS, JS, and images are in their respective directories
- Cron jobs are stored in the crons/ directory

### Naming Conventions
- PHP files are named descriptively according to their function
- Files that perform similar functions have consistent naming patterns (e.g., search_*.php)

### Code Patterns
- Database connection likely handled through db.php
- Core medication functions are centralized in med_functions.php
- Form submissions typically processed by dedicated PHP files
