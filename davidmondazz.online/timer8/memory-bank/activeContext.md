# Active Context

## Current Work Focus
The Timer8 Online project is currently at a stable production state with ongoing improvements and feature additions. The focus is on enhancing user experience, improving reliability during network disruptions, and preparing for future scalability.

## Recent Changes
- Implementation of the difficulty multiplier system to adjust reward rates
- Addition of a marketplace feature for spending accumulated currency
- Visual improvements to the timer display with millisecond precision
- Bank system for tracking and managing accumulated rewards
- Offline mode support with improved error handling during network issues

## Next Steps

### Short-term Tasks
- **Performance Optimization**: Reduce resource usage for long-running timers
- **UI Enhancement**: Improve mobile responsiveness for small screens
- **Backend Stability**: Improve error handling and recovery mechanisms
- **Security**: Migrate hardcoded credentials to a secure configuration system

### Medium-term Priorities
- **User Accounts**: Implement multi-user support with authentication
- **Stats Dashboard**: Add analytics and insights about time usage
- **Export/Import**: Allow data portability between systems

- **Offline-First Architecture**: Fully functional offline experience with sync

## Active Decisions

### Technical Decisions
- **Continue with pure JavaScript**: No immediate plans to adopt a framework
- **PHP Backend**: Maintain the PHP/MySQL stack for server components
- **Database Structure**: Current schema is sufficient for planned features

### Product Decisions
- **Focus on Core Experience**: Prioritize timer reliability and reward mechanism
- **Gradual Feature Addition**: Introduce new features incrementally to maintain stability
- **Visual Identity**: Maintain the current clean, functional aesthetic

## Current Challenges
- **Syncing Accuracy**: Ensuring accurate time tracking during connectivity issues
- **Database Scaling**: Preparing for growth in timer count and user base
- **Browser Compatibility**: Supporting older browsers while adding modern features
- **UX Consistency**: Maintaining a cohesive experience across all features
